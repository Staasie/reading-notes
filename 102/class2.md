# What is HTML and why use it?

HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:

_3 main parts of an HTML element?_

+ The opening/closing tag

+ The content

+ The element

_What is it called when you give an element extra information?_

+ An attribute

_What is a semantic element?_

+ Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code.
