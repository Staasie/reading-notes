## What went wrong?

_Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error._

**Detection:**

+ Syntax Error: Found during compilation or interpretation.
+ Logic Error: Found during runtime through incorrect outputs.

**Error Messages:**

+ Syntax Error: Provides clear and specific error messages.
+ Logic Error: No error messages; requires debugging and testing.

**Impact:**

+ Syntax Error: Prevents the program from running.
+ Logic Error: Program runs but produces incorrect results.

_List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them._

+ Simple camas that were in the wrong spot and to fix it i just stare at it for a very long time and get mad aanndd then i cross ref the things ive doon in the past and if i cant figure it out ill ask a classmate or chat gpt.

_How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?_

+ its something to come back to if im feeling stuck and need a little umph. A nice reminder of the tools we have on stand by that may get overlooked

## JavaScripe Debugger

_How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?_

+ The JavaScript Debugger is like a pause button for your website's code. It stops the code at certain points so you can check what’s happening, see if things are working right, and fix mistakes.

_Define what a breakpoint is._

+ they're markers you set in your code to pause its execution at specific lines. When the program runs and hits a breakpoint, it stops so you can look at the current state of the program and see what’s happening step by step.Allows you to test how your code behaves up to that point. They let you actively debug while its running vs after everything's over an done with.

_What is the call stack?_

+ Shows you what code was executed to get to the current line.
