# Read: Class 14: Psychological Safety

_What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?_

+ _Open communication_
+ _Mutual respect and trust-
+ _Inclusive Leadership_

_Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety._

+ Back when i was a teen i used to volunteer at the humane society, I mostly just walked the dogs and played with the animals to boost moral an whatnot. One day a dog named muddy that had been there for quite some time had been showing huge signs of depression we had all assumed it was cause all his friends were going an yet he was still stuck there in his cage, muddy didnt get a lot of attention cause of his exterior he was pretty beaten up on the outside, patchy fur and droopy mouth from fights (he was a pitbull). All the volunteers had came together to try an boost the time muddy had in there to make him more happy, we were all throwing out ideas and making schedules and a lot of us had a lot of different ones and it got super chaotic but we all kept it very sweet cause we all knew we just wanted muddy to be happy and find a home, we talked about it for nearly a week about things we could do and toys we could bring and treats and walks and it was honestly such a great experience it was one of the first things i collaborated with people on and actually came to a good honest decision and honestly one of the few things ill never forget.

_What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?_

+they create a good mental environment that allow everyone in the group feel like they can speak freely that way ideas that some may think arent good in their heads can be said freely without judgement while also having the potential to do something great. they can get more done and have a stress free environment making it possible to get more done.

## CSS Transforms

_What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?_

+ CSS transform allows a dev to manipulate an element's appearance/positioning without affecting the document flow. It can change the shape, size, position, and orientation of an element through transformations like rotation, scaling, translation, and skewing.

ex.
div {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: green;
  transform: rotate(45deg);
}

_Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website._

+ An interactive button that rotates a little or an image to scale or rotate

## CSS Transitions & Animations

_What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?_

+ It allows dev's to make more complex and continuous animations they dont need something to trigger it. animations that are controlled with keyframes which define start and end steps.

ex.
@keyframes bounce {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
  50% {
    transform: translateY(-20px);
  }
}

div {
  animation: bounce 1s infinite;
