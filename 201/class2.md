# Read: Class 02

_Importance of this read_
I think doing a review is always nice to do off the jump cause it allows you to reflect back to what you've already done and puts you back in the mindset of code. i think its good to reflect back on things you otherwise over look an think aren't important but should want to know the answers to fairly quickly as they are things you think of and use everyday in class and in schoolwork.
I also think its a super important think to know how CSS works cause without it no matter what you do for the most part your website will always just look like a markdown basic site without any pazaz!
Learning JavaScript basics is huge because without knowing how it starts you will never fully understand why you do the things you do. Learnings the starter things now are super important so you will have less "whys" later on in projects.
