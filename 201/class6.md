## JavaScript Object Basics

_How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?_

+ an object is just a bundle of related information stored together in a way that makes it easy to find. Instead of random pieces scattered everywhere.

_What are some advantages to creating object literals?_

+ very easy to read
+ short an sweet
+ no confusion its all laid out
+ quick

_How do objects differ from arrays?_

+ Arrays are just lists of items in order.
+ Objects are boxes with labels, so you can find specific details by name instead of order.

_Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an object’s property instead of dot notation._

+ generally you'd want to use dot notation cause its simpler. bracket notation is useful for dynamically accessing properties and handling special cases where dot notation doesn’t work. its good for when you say dont know the name ahead of time orrr the name has special characters.

_Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?_

+ this is object literals and its super simple to read and clean.

## DOM

_What is the DOM?_

+ DOM reps the document as nodes and objects so that programming languages can actually interact with the page

_Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript._

+ DOM is the structure and JS manipulates the DOM (structure) they work together to make a page as a whole
