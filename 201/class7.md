## Domain Modeling

_Explain why we need domain modeling._
+we use it to map out the important features so everyone can understand it better and so its easier to understand it also makes it much easier to change later on

## HTML Table Basics

_Why should tables not be used for page layouts?_

+ Layout tables reduce accessibility
+ they produce tag soup
+and they aren't automatically responsive

_List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML < table >._

+ < thead >: Defines the header section of a table, typically containing < th > cells, which label the data in each column and make tables easier to interpret.

+ < tbody >: Encloses the main body of table data, organizing rows (< tr >) and columns for clarity, especially in large tables.

+ < tfoot >: Marks the footer section, often used for summary rows or totals, providing a final, organized reference point after the main content.

## Introducing Constructors

_What is a constructor and what does it do?_

+ A constructor is a special function in object-oriented programming languages,  are some advantages to using it?_
+ constructors is a standard practice that leads to more predictable, organized, and maintainable code when working with objects in JavaScript and other object-oriented languages.

_How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?_

+When this is used within an object literal, it refers to the object itself. In other words, this points to the object in which the function is defined

+ When this is used within a constructor (or class), it refers to the instance of the object being created

## Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

_Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience._

+ Prototypes and inheritance are key concepts in JavaScriptâ€™s object-oriented programming, allowing objects to share properties and methods efficiently without duplication. (i cannot think of a way to put this into what its asking.)
