## Learn CSS - Flexbox

_Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. Explain what this means._

+ Flexbox handles layouts in one direction at a time, either a row (horizontal) or a column (vertical). Itâ€™s great for aligning and spacing items along that single direction.

_Explain the difference between the main axis and cross axis._

+ The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property. If that is row your main axis is along the row, if it is column your main axis is along the column.

+ The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis, so if flex-direction is row the cross axis runs along the column.

_How can using certain properties of flexbox negatively impact accessibility?_

+ Using properties like row-reverse and column-reverse can hurt accessibility because they only change how items look, not the order in the HTML. Screen readers and keyboards follow the original order, which can confuse users.
