# Here's a classic spaghetti recipe that's simple and delicious

Ingredients

+ 8 oz spaghetti (about half a box)
+ 2 tbsp olive oil
+ 2 cloves garlic, minced
+ 1 can (14 oz) crushed tomatoes (or diced tomatoes if you prefer more texture)
+ Salt and pepper to taste
+ 1 tsp dried basil
+ 1 tsp dried oregano
+ 1/2 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)
+ Parmesan cheese for serving
+ Fresh basil or parsley, chopped (optional for garnish)
+ Instructions
+ Cook the Spaghetti

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
Add the spaghetti and cook according to package instructions until al dente.
Drain the spaghetti, but save about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.
Prepare the Sauce

While the pasta is cooking, heat 2 tbsp of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
Add the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
Pour in the crushed tomatoes. Add basil, oregano, salt, pepper, and sugar if using.
Simmer for about 10-15 minutes until the sauce thickens slightly. Stir occasionally.
Combine Pasta and Sauce

Add the cooked spaghetti to the sauce, tossing to coat.
If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water until it reaches your desired consistency.
Serve

Plate the spaghetti, sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.
Enjoy!
